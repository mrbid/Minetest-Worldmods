# Minetest-Worldmods
A collection of worldmods used on the VF-TECHNIC minetest server.

## Highlights
- insane amount of unlisted bug fixes to pretty much every mod
- fixing all bugs and offsets in `/vehicles` _(D00Med Vehicles)_
- addition of biofuel chainsaws _(based on technic chainsaw)_
- addition of powerbank mk4 _(zero-point energy)_
- addition of super biofuel and super propane
- fixes to all bugs in [technic_tweak](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=14510)
- additions to technic_chests _(such as titanium vacuuming chest, amethyst mining chest, mystery boxes, and diamond gift boxes / duplicators)_
- merging of [space_travel](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=23455) nodes with [other_worlds](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=16015) to create a more diverse set of asteroid layers, the vanilla space_travel mod produced too much lag to run online as-is.
- modification of all technic_armor skins to remove specular highlights
- some new admin commands in `/exploration` such as a jailing system for disruptive players.
- removal of technic polyfuse and machine protection _(allowing machines to be shared, upgrades are protected however)_
- replaced technic cnc with [Improved Technic CNC](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/technic_cnc_improve/) and made some improvements upon its supported nodelist.
- significant rework on commodity markets listed items string formatting to ensure a concise, pretty, and still informative item string.
- modifications to [edit mod](https://github.com/mrbid/Minetest-Worldmods/tree/main/worldmods/edit) to make it safer for use by builders.
- bones chests in different fun colours, so you can trophy your kills.
- technic_gen machines that generate cobble
- pipeworks autocrafters now have three tiers of speed
- abm that converts lead to gold when 3.5% uranium blocks are placed next to it. ([1972 Lake Baikal in Siberia](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/webprojects2002/crabb/modern.html))
- HV Dark Matter Transmuter, a new technic machine that uses Dark Matter Crystals and Blocks to transmute ores, ingots, and ingot blocks.
- some new amusing/trick food items under the "hawk" mod
- improved automobiles with passenger support and extended skins (locked, private access for driver)
- automobiles2 with 4x passenger support, tiers of handling and public access to drive (and flying versions)
- abriglass has been updated with cornered one-way glass thanks to Test_User.
- we have plasma_mod by two which has nodes with instant kill properties, a great replacement to lava for protecting your base from users glitching through walls.
- maidroid was a little too buggy and pointless so it's been re-implemented as a simple NPC.
- added HV Biomass Generator, consumes bones (bones:bones, bonemeal:bone, foody:bone) and produces power. 100x the power of a HV Battery Box.
- replaced the model on cars:car and then adapted it to a jets:jet for the VF-MESHNODE server as a novel method of increasing player speed.
- titanium chests now harvest nearby items on mesecon signal.
- a much improved and extended version of stacked ingots mod has been added, added support for more ingots, some improved textures, crafts for full stacks and better stack descriptions.
- added moreores support to [hidden doors](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=18294).
- texture alpha/transparency support added to Technic CNC & Mymillworks.
- added glowfences for mese fences and caverealms glow crystal fences.
- Test_User has refactored the code of [unified_inventory](https://github.com/minetest-mods/unified_inventory) in api.lua to vastly improve load times of the server when rebooting.
- Created a new framed & coloured glass mod called `cglass`.
- Created a lightweight `roadnodes` mod using textures taken from the not-so-lightweight [streets](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=2984) mod.
- Improved cncnodes to merge the best nodes from `technic_cnc_improved`, `mymillwork`, and `mymeshnodes` mods. The merged mod is called `cncnodes`.
- added a `chest_of_forbidden:chest` that displays every `not_in_creative_inventory=1` node, it's a fork of the devtest Chest of Everything.
- added a Chest of Everything to display just the CNC nodes `chest_of_cnc:chest`, and removing the CNC nodes from the creative inventory.
- added an improved Chest of Everything for creative users.
- fixed sit animation breaking physics effects in `ts_furniture`.

## TODO
- the `more_chests` toolbox ownership / protection is not working, needs to be fixed.
- `xocean` coral `on_destroy` methods often cause crashes, these should probably just be removed and crafts added to produce their counterpart nodes that would once have been placed by the `on_destroy` method.
- `cnc` aka the technic cnc improved has some duplicate shapes that can be obtained via rotations using the screwdriver and thus could be replaced with unique ones from `jamesnodes` which is a congregation of all significant unique nodes from `mymillworks` and `mymeshnodes`.
- `automobiles` and `automobiles2` although cars are unlocked to most players they still have an owner and only the owner _(or an admin)_ can break the vehicle to an item for inventory pickup so it's probably worth adding an infotext to the vehicles so that the owner can be identified.
- `abriglass` new oneway corner and edge glass need crafts
- `cglass` and `roadnodes` need crafts
- `armor_addon` rhodochrosite and shadow armor could do with crafts
- `bakedclayx` could do with crafts for the extended colours (using unifieddyes)
- `btw` monument light has no craft
- `worldmods/furnishings_mods/homedecor_modpack/homedecor_seating/sofas.lua` and `armchairs.lua` could do with some proper sit code to change the player animation. You could also say the same for the `xdecor` chairs. At the moment only `ts_furniture` has proper sit animations. ~~but it's notable this too is buggy as it resets player physics.. breaking any armor set physics... so all in all, furniture is one big mess.~~
- `snowcone` mod has been removed because the machine cannot be 'dug' when full of juice - but also tends to never fully empty at times.
- `automobiles` and `automobiles2` mods need their first-person view eye offsets corrected but this requires adding bones to the seat positions of the SUV model _(or entities like APercy does, but we prefer the bone method to reduce lag)_.

## DONE
~~- transparency support needs to be added to `mymillwork` for the caverealms glow crystal cuts~~<br>
~~- some of the doors such as the diamond door in the `doors` mod open up inverse, this needs to be fixed.~~<br>
~~- Gold trapdoor in `doors` has no craft and: Adamantine door, Aquarium door, Brass door.~~<br>
~~- `packed_things` nodes need to be updated with node group sounds that represent the original node being packed.~~<br>
~~- `ingots_extended` needs metal groups for dig sounds, also needs terumet support, possibly even the other xtraores mod support, which could be confusing because they both share the same name.~~<br>
~~- technic crafting types `freezing`, `alloying`, `extracting`, `compressing`, `grinding`, `transmuting`, `separating`, could do with icons for the i3 inventory.~~

## Notes
To load all these mods at the same time you will need to modify your minetest server:<br>
`<Test_User> src/mapnode.h:45, change "#define MAX_REGISTERED_CONTENT *" to "#define MAX_REGISTERED_CONTENT 0xf800U"`

Server is compiled with -Ofast rather than -O3. This is adjusted in the makefile.

~~We are now running Buckaroo's mapserver: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=21999~~<br>
~~Zeno's IRC mod: https://github.com/Zeno-/minetest-irc~~<br>
~~Vehicles, Planes, and Aquatics from: https://github.com/APercy~~

## Warning
Most of these mods have been modified from their original state to create a harmony between them all, hence, updating mods in this pack may break things, create crafting collisions, etc. Beware.

## Test_User jailing LUA node script:
player_detector > injector_controller > luablock
```
corner_1 = {x=-798,y=43,z=-1148}
corner_2 = {x=-765,y=20,z=-1182}

local detector_pos = {x=-780,y=21,z=-1167}

local is_in = function(tbl, val)
  for _, v in pairs(tbl) do
    if v == val then return true end
  end
  return false
end

local meta = minetest.get_meta(detector_pos)
local names = meta:get_string("scanname"):split(",")

local playerlist = {}
local objects = minetest.get_objects_in_area(corner_1, corner_2)
for _, object in pairs(objects) do
  if object:is_player() then
    table.insert(playerlist, object:get_player_name())
  end
end

local online = {}
for _, player in pairs(minetest.get_connected_players()) do
  table.insert(online, player:get_player_name())
end

for _, name in pairs(names) do
  if is_in(online, name) and not is_in(playerlist, name) then
    local player = minetest.get_player_by_name(name)
    player:set_detach()
    player:set_pos(vector.add(detector_pos, {x=0,y=1,z=0}))
  end
end
```

## skinsdb invis code
_this will reset your skin back to normal on hotbar item change, causing an avatar update to display the new visual tool selected._
```
invis:
/lua local p = minetest.get_player_by_name('@nearest'); p:set_nametag_attributes({color = {a = 0, r = 255, g = 255, b = 255}}) p:set_properties({visual = "mesh", textures={"character_1917.png"}, visual_size = {x=0, y=0}, pointable=false})

normal:
/lua local p = minetest.get_player_by_name('@nearest'); p:set_nametag_attributes({color = {a = 255, r = 255, g = 255, b = 255}}) p:set_properties({visual = "mesh", textures={"character_454.png"}, visual_size = {x=1, y=1}, pointable=true})
```

## Helpful lua to count items and nodes registered on the server
```
//lua local icount, ncount = 0, 0; for _, _ in pairs(minetest.registered_items) do icount = icount + 1 end; for _, _ in pairs(minetest.registered_nodes) do ncount = ncount + 1 end; minetest.chat_send_all(tostring(icount).." "..tostring(ncount))
```

## Solution to every pipeworks bug (not a joke)
```
if not player/user/clicker.get_meta then return end
```

## Bug in ma_pops_furniture
A bug discovered when calling the check_table() function causes a crash when certain tables of a non-expected naming convention are used, specifically that I am aware of, the wood and cobble tables. The solution I have opted for to comment out all calls to this function as I deem the optimization of legs when placing tables next to one another superfluous .. however this may change in the future as user "Test_User" put in some considerable time to find the exact problem as listed above and provide a solution to said problem as listed below:
```
functions.lua on line 114, should be able to replace if check_this then with if check_this and material ~= "_wood" then
or, if the wood one did have other forms, at the start if material == "_wood" then material = "wood" end
```
To trigger this you would add a wooden table next to an acacia table for example, and the optimization of legs performed by the check_table() function would cause a crash.
