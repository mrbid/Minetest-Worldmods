Ciao!
This is my first mod, so sorry if there are any errors or english typos.

This mod adds to your minetest game various type of sandwiches,
including vegetarian, nutella bacon, pb&j, bacon and many more
if you have supported mods like BBQ and cucina_vegana!
There are also some other related food like a sweet bread pudding,
made from sandwiches crumbs and jam.

Developed and tested on Minetest 0.4.17, works for 0.4.16 too.

Current version: Current version: v1.7 added cucina_vegana compatibility + more sandwiches
v 1.6 - added bbq compatibility + chicken strips
v 1.5 - added ethereal compatibility and lots of sandwiches
v 1.4 - peanut crop and bacon added
v 1.3 - made moretrees optional
v 1.2 - replaced meat with craftable ham
v 1.1 - fixed some on_use values
v 1.0 - the very first release;

This mod has some dependencies, so be careful with the installation.
